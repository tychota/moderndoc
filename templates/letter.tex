\setkomavar{subject}{Re: Collaboration Proposal for Research Project}
\setkomavar{date}{\today}

\opening{Dear Dr.\ Smith,}

I am writing to propose a collaboration between our organizations on the
upcoming research initiative. Following our discussion at the recent
conference, I believe there is significant potential for a mutually
beneficial partnership.

Our team has extensive experience in the relevant domain, and we are
particularly interested in exploring the intersection of our respective
areas of expertise. The proposed collaboration would focus on:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Joint development of novel methodologies
  \item Shared access to research facilities and datasets
  \item Co-authorship of resulting publications
  \item Student and researcher exchange programs
\end{enumerate}

I have attached a detailed proposal document outlining the scope, timeline,
and resource requirements for the project. The proposed budget has been
developed in consultation with our finance department and reflects realistic
cost estimates for a project of this scale.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal in more detail at
your earliest convenience. Please let me know if you require any additional
information or clarification.

Thank you for considering this proposal. I look forward to hearing from you
and hope we can work together on this exciting opportunity.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\opening{Dear Mr.\ Brown,}

I am writing to formally apply for a sabbatical leave for the academic year
2025--2026. In accordance with university policy, I am submitting this
application six months in advance of the proposed start date.

During the sabbatical period, I plan to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Complete my book manuscript on advanced research methods
  \item Conduct field research in collaboration with international partners
  \item Develop new course materials for the graduate curriculum
\end{itemize}

I have arranged for colleagues to cover my teaching and administrative
responsibilities during my absence. A detailed plan is attached for your
review.

Thank you for your consideration of this application.
