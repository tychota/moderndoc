\chapter{Down the Rabbit-Hole}

\begin{chapterquote}{Lewis Carroll}{1865}
What is the use of a book without pictures or conversations?
\end{chapterquote}

\lettrine{A}{lice} was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book
her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ``and
what is the use of a book,'' thought Alice ``without pictures or
conversations?''

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day
made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a
daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so \textit{very} remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
\textit{very} much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ``Oh dear!
Oh dear! I shall be late!'' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed
quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually \textit{took a watch out of its
waistcoat-pocket}, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time
to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

\chapter{The Pool of Tears}

\lettrine{C}{uriouser} and curiouser!'' cried Alice (she was so much surprised,
that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); ``now I'm
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'' (for
when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they
were getting so far off). ``Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure \textit{I} shan't be
able!''

\chapter{A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale}

\lettrine{T}{hey} were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the
bank---the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging
close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation
about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find
herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.

\chapter{The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill}

\lettrine{I}{t} was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it
muttering to itself ``The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and
whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where
\textit{can} I have dropped them, I wonder?''

Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white
kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they
were nowhere to be seen---everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had
vanished completely.

\chapter{Advice from a Caterpillar}

\lettrine{T}{he}
Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth,
and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

``Who are \textit{you}?'' said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather
shyly, ``I---I hardly know, sir, just at present---at least I know who I
\textit{was} when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed
several times since then.''
