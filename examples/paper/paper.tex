\begin{abstract} 
This paper explores the evolution of digital typography and its impact on
modern document design. We analyze the transition from mechanical to digital
typesetting and discuss the principles that ensure readability in the age of
ubiquitous screens.

\section{Introduction}

The transition from lead-based movable type to digital character encoding has
democratized the art of typography. Today, professional-grade tools like
LuaLaTeX and the IBM Plex font family are available to everyone.

\section{The Evolution of Type}

As noted by \textcite{bringhurst2004elements}, typography exists to honor
content. The Digital Age has introduced new challenges, such as rendering type
on low-resolution displays and maintaining consistency across diverse devices.

\section{Proposed Framework}

We propose a modular approach to document styling, as implemented in the
\software{modern-doc} package. This framework separates structural content from
visual presentation.

\begin{equation}
  S = f(C, T, L)
  \label{eq:style}
\end{equation}

where $S$ is the final style, $C$ is the content, $T$ is the template, and $L$
is the layout logic as shown in \cref{eq:style}.

\section{Experimental Results}

Our tests on various font families show that the IBM Plex family achieves high
readability scores across different screen sizes.

\begin{table}[h]

  \caption{Readability Scores}
  \begin{tblr}{hlines, vlines}
    Font Family & Screen & Score \\
    IBM Plex    & 4K     & 9.8   \\
    IBM Plex    & Mobile & 9.2   \\
    Standard    & 4K     & 8.5   \\
  \end{tblr}
\end{table}

\section{Conclusion}

Digital typography continues to evolve, blending traditional principles with
modern technological capabilities.
