\chapter{Executive Summary}

This report highlights the significant milestones in the field of digital
typography over the past year.

\chapter{Infrastructure Analysis}

The adoption of LuaLaTeX has reached new heights, providing better support for
OpenType fonts and complex layouts.

\section{Font Performance}

We have observed that variable fonts are becoming more prevalent in the design
industry.

\begin{notebox}
Variable fonts allow for a single font file to contain multiple weights and
styles, reducing the overhead for web and document distribution.
\end{notebox}

\chapter{Future Outlook}

We anticipate that AI-driven typography will become a major trend in 2026.
