\opening{Lieutenant-General Grant,}

Not expecting to see you again before the spring campaign opens, I wish to
express, in this way, my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to this
time, so far as I understand it.

The particulars of your plans I neither know, or seek to know. You are vigilant
and self reliant; and, pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude any constraints
or restraints upon you. While I am very anxious that any great disaster, or the
capture of our men in great numbers, shall be avoided, I know these points are
less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine.

If there is anything wanting which is within my power to give, do not fail to
let me know it.

And now with a brave Army, and a just cause, may God sustain you.

\closing{Yours very truly,}
