For decades, it has been the gold standard for beautiful, high-quality typography in scientific and technical documents. The precision of its layout algorithms, the quality of its mathematical typesetting, and its robustness are unmatched.</p> <p>However, LaTeX has a steep learning curve. *   Complexity: Configuring a document with modern fonts, colors, and layouts often requires digging through obscure package documentation and 20-year-old forum posts. *   Outdated Defaults: The default \"Computer Modern\" look, while iconic, instantly dates a document. *   Fragmented Ecosystem: Finding the right combination of packages that work together (e.g., bibliography, code highlighting, tables) is a trial-and-error process.</p> <p>ModernDoc exists to solve these problems. We believe that producing a professional, archival-quality document shouldn't require a degree in TeX programming. You should be able to focus on your content while the system handles the typography.</p>"},{"location":"#what-moderndoc-offers","title":"What ModernDoc Offers","text":"<p>ModernDoc is an \"opinionated\" set of templates and a powerful style package (<code>moderndoc.sty</code>) that gives you:</p> <ul> <li>Modern Aesthetics: Built-in support for the IBM Plex font family\u2014a typeface designed to capture the relationship between mankind and machine.</li> <li>Archival Quality: Default output to PDF/A-4, the latest standard for long-term document preservation.</li> <li>Batteries Included: Pre-configured setups for Code (minted), Bibliography (biblatex), Tables (tabularray), and more.</li> <li>Agent-Ready: Designed to work seamlessly with AI agents via AgentSkills, allowing you to generate and modify documents using natural language.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li>Typography: Microtype enabled, carefully tuned line spreads and margins.</li> <li>Fonts: IBM Plex Serif, Sans, Mono, and JP (Japanese) bundled.</li> <li>Templates: Ready-to-use layouts for Articles, Books, Theses, Reports, and Letters.</li> <li>Efficiency: Fast compilation with LuaLaTeX.</li> </ul> <p>Get Started</p>"},{"location":"advanced/","title":"Advanced Considerations","text":"<p>ModernDoc is not just a template; it is a carefully curated set of typographic choices designed to convey professionalism and readability.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/#typography-design","title":"Typography &amp; Design","text":""},{"location":"advanced/#why-ibm-plex","title":"Why IBM Plex?","text":"<p>The default typeface for ModernDoc is IBM Plex.</p> <p>\"IBM Plex is designed to capture the relationship between mankind and machine.\" \u2014 IBM Design</p> <p>We chose IBM Plex for several reasons: 1.
