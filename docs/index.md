# Welcome to ModernDoc

**ModernDoc** is a comprehensive LuaLaTeX template repository designed to bridge the gap between the timeless beauty of LaTeX and the efficiency of modern workflows.

## The Motivation

We love LaTeX. For decades, it has been the gold standard for beautiful, high-quality typography in scientific and technical documents. The precision of its layout algorithms, the quality of its mathematical typesetting, and its robustness are unmatched.

**However, LaTeX has a steep learning curve.**

- **Complexity**: Configuring a document with modern fonts, colors, and layouts often requires digging through obscure package documentation and 20-year-old forum posts.
- **Outdated Defaults**: The default "Computer Modern" look, while iconic, instantly dates a document.
- **Fragmented Ecosystem**: Finding the right combination of packages that work together (e.g., bibliography, code highlighting, tables) is a trial-and-error process.

**ModernDoc exists to solve these problems.** We believe that producing a professional, archival-quality document shouldn't require a degree in TeX programming. You should be able to focus on your content while the system handles the typography.

## What ModernDoc Offers

ModernDoc is an "opinionated" set of templates and a powerful style package (`moderndoc.sty`) that gives you:

- **Modern Aesthetics**: Built-in support for the [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) font family—a typeface designed to capture the relationship between mankind and machine.
- **Archival Quality**: Default output to **PDF/A-4**, the latest standard for long-term document preservation.
- **Batteries Included**: Pre-configured setups for Code (minted), Bibliography (biblatex), Tables (tabularray), and more.
- **Agent-Ready**: Designed to work seamlessly with AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), allowing you to generate and modify documents using natural language.

## Key Features

- **Typography**: Microtype enabled, carefully tuned line spreads and margins.
- **Fonts**: IBM Plex Serif, Sans, Mono, and JP (Japanese) bundled.
- **Templates**: Ready-to-use layouts for Articles, Books, Theses, Reports, and Letters.
- **Efficiency**: Fast compilation with LuaLaTeX.
